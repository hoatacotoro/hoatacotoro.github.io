after you start the game it says how many tries you have to guess the number. also as you can see here computer chooses a number from 1 to 10 and gives you a chance to guess the mystery number and after every guess it will say if its higher or lower than the chosen number so its pretty easy to actually guess the number only on easy mode though because in hard mode you have only 1 try to guess the number so its basically just random if youre gonna guess it or not

## personal records
game stores your personal record until the game is closed. you can track your pr at the main screen, to go there you have to say no when game prompts you to continue playing or just lose

theres also some ***cheat codes*** to change your pr
